# Federation support

Python Keystone is not implementing the Federation natively (neither SAML2, nor
OIDC). It relies on the proxy server for the authentication protocol specifics
and tries to map resulting users into the local database. This leads to a
pretty big number of limitations (not limited to):

- Identity Provider can be only configured by cloud administrators only

- Pretty much any change on the IdP configuration require restart of the service

- Certain protocol specifics can not be implemented at all (i.e. backend
  initiated logout)

- Forces deployment of the proxy service in front of Keystone relying on the
  modules for SAML2 and/or OIDC implementation (such modules may be abandoned
  or removed).

- Client authentication right now is complex and error prone (every public
  provider has implementation specifics that are often even not cross-compatible)

In order to address those challenges a complete reimplementation is being done
with a different design. This allows implementing features not technically
possible in the py-keystone:

- Federation is controlled on the domain level by the domain managers. This
  means that the domain manager is responsible for the configuration of how users
  should be federated from external IdPs.

- Identity providers and/or attribute mappings can be reused by different
  domains allowing implementing social logins.

- Keystone serves as a relying party in the OIDC authentication flow. It
  decreases amount of different flows to the minimum making client applications
  much simpler and more reliable.


## API changes

A series of brand new API endpoints have been added to the Keystone API.

- **/v4/federation/identity_providers** (manage the identity providers)

- **/v4/federation/mappings** (manage the mappings tied to the identity provider)

- **/v4/federation/auth** (initiate the authentication and get the IdP url)

- **/v4/federation/oidc/callback** (exchange the authorization code for the Keystone token)

- **/v4/federation/identity_providers/{idp_id}/jwt**
  (exchange the JWT token issued by the referred IdP for the Keystone token)

## DB changes

Following tables are added:

- federated_identity_provider

```rust
{{#rustdoc_include ../../src/db/entity/federated_identity_provider.rs:9:22}}
```

- federated_mapping

```rust
{{#include ../../src/db/entity/federated_mapping.rs:10:26}}
```

- federated_auth_state

```rust
{{#include ../../src/db/entity/federated_auth_state.rs:8:16}}
```


## Compatibility notes

Since the federation is implemented very differently to how it was done before
it certain compatibility steps are implemented:

- Identity provider is "mirrored" into the existing identity_provider with the
  subset of attributes

- For every identity provider "oidc" and "jwt" protocol entries in the
  federation_protocol table is created pointing to the "\<\<null\>\>" mapping.

## Testing

Federation is very complex and need to be tested with every supported public
provider. Only this can guarantee that issues with not fully compliant OIDC
implementations can be identified early enough.

Authorization code flow requires presence of the browser. Due to that the tests
need to rely on Selenium.

At the moment following integrations are tested automatically:

- Keycloak (login using browser)
- Keycloak (login with JWT)
- GitHub (workload federation with JWT)
